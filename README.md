# calculator
A simple project for learning rust and getting familiar with parser generators.

This uses the [pest](https://crates.io/crates/pest) parser generator to create a 4-function calculator, with support for order of operations and parentheses. 
In hindsight, I didn't learn much rust (it's barely a hundred lines), but this was a good intro into more complicated grammars. It made compilers and interpreters 
drastically less intimidating.
